# Model analysis project
In the IS-LM model, we start by examining the goods market. According to fundamental economic principles, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at any specific time (t) comprises household consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports. For this model, we assume a closed economy, indicating the absence of international trade, where the country functions as a self-contained economy.

You can observe the results of the project by running the IS-LMModelproject.ipynb notebook.

Aside from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, no additional packages are required for this project.
