**Fertility and Inflation.**

Our project is titled "How does inflation  affect fertility" 

We have decided to custumize the excel sheet into a 5 year age group ranging from 15-19, 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, 40-44 and 45-49, despite this have we still performed data cleaning methods on this data, thus we would argue we does not hinder 

We want to see how inflation affects the fertility, we have also included Gross Domestic Product as this gives an indication on how the economic situation is in our country

The final graph of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb), note you can click on the Titles (names Metrics) to exlcude a graph, hold your cursor over a datapoint to see the exact values and last also zoom in.



**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``
Sometimes the data can be tricky to load so you might need to install 
''pip install nbformat --upgrade''
